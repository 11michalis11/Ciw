Welcome to Ciw's documentation!
===============================

Etymology: **Ciw**
    *noun* Welsh word for a queue. *pl.* ciwiau.

Ciw is a discrete event simulation library for open queueing networks. It's core features include the capability to simulate networks of queues, multiple customer classes, and implementation of Type I blocking for restricted networks. A number of other features are also implemented, including priorities, baulking, schedules, and deadlock detection.

The documentation contains a two part tutortial that guides the user through some key concepts and core features of the library. A series of How-to guides instruct on the use and implementation of Ciw's numerous features, and reference pages and background information is available to ensure ease of use and understanding.

Please note that Ciw is currently supported for and regularly tested on Python versions 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5. However, for the documentation we assume Python 3 is used.
